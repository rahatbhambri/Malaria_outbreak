# Malaria Outbreak Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts malaria outbreaks using a machine learning model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model forecasts outbreaks 15â€“20 days in advance with high accuracy, leveraging historical data and environmental factors.

## Features
- Predicts malaria outbreaks up to 20 days in advance.
- Utilizes climate and health data for forecasting.
- Implements an SVM-based machine learning model.
- Provides visualization of prediction results.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahatbhambri/Malaria_outbreak.git
cd Malaria_outbreak
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset (ensure data is in the expected format).
2. Run the model:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
3. Review the predictions and visualization outputs.


## Results
- Model accuracy and performance metrics.
- Key findings from prediction analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with additional features.
- Implement deep learning models for better predictions.
- Develop a web or mobile application for real-time alerts.
