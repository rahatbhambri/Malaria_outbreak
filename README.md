# Malaria_outbreak
The model “Malaria outbreak prediction Model using Machine Learning” can help as an early warning tool to identify potential outbreaks of Malaria. In this study two popular data mining classification algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are used for Malaria prediction using a large dataset of Maharashtra state.

It is observed that performance of the model developed using SVM is more accurate than ANN. The SVM model can predict the outbreak 15 -20 days in advance. However accuracy of prediction can be increased using more training data. This model can be scaled-up at country level.
